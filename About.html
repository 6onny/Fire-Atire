    About
  </h1>
 Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Estiphanos, the founder of fire attire. I am from Toronto Canada and im 15 years old.Im an Ethiopian male making a buisness for clothing mainly for teenagers of my age. I grew up with no drip and i understand how hard it is to find good affordable clothes. I was also struggling to get the money for said clothes. So I made a website to help people easily sell and buy drip.
